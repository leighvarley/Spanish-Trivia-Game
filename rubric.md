## Project Workflow
I like your user stories. It would be really nice if you included in the readme the process you took along the path to completing your project. As well as any roadblocks you may have faced. Additionally something nice to add in the readme is things you would like to accomplish moving forward.

## Technical Requirements
Although the JS is a little light, it handles the quiz logic and keeps track of the score. Going forward, I would definitely start thinking about how we might transfer some of the quiz content out of the HTML and into an object instead.

## Creativity
The page looks nice and clean. And i like the idea of spanish trivia!

## Code Quality
Code indentation needs some work on the HTML side, but JS code indentation looks good. I saw some comments and would love to see more of those. Specifically what the functionality of the program is doing in your code base. I liked your psuedocode

## Problem Solving
I think you did a good job breaking down this problem into its component parts. I think the next step is how to tackle making this site more modular and scalable.

## Total
1- meets expectations. I think you have a decent understanding of the concepts we've covered thus far in this course. However, I definitely encourage you to try and get some of the content out of the HTML and see how you can modularize your code so that we can add content(more questions) more easily.
